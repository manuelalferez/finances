## Create your categories here

If your data are from Revolut, create a file called:
incomes_categories.txt
Then enter in the names of the concepts that belong to income, since Revolut provides
us with all the values in positive.

The format of the file should be such that so:

~~~
[concept1]
[concept2]
.
.
.
[conceptn]
~~~

**Categorization**

On the other hand, now it's time to categorize.
Create a file, where the categories will be, with the name "categories.csv" and the following format:

~~~
[part of the concept 1];[part of the concept 2];[part of the concept 3];[part of the concept 4]
[category 1];[category 2]
~~~

Example:

~~~
Donald;Mcd;MCDONALDS;MACDONALS
restaurants;mcdonald
~~~

The separation of the file should be such that so:

~~~
[part of the concept 1];[part of the concept 2];[part of the concept 3];[part of the concept 4]
[category 1];[category 2]
~~~
(blank line)
~~~
[part of the concept 1];[part of the concept 2];[part of the concept 3];[part of the concept 4]
[category 1];[category 2]
~~~
(blank line)
~~~
[part of the concept 1];[part of the concept 2];[part of the concept 3];[part of the concept 4]
[category 1];[category 2]
~~~
(blank line)
~~~
[part of the concept 1];[part of the concept 2];[part of the concept 3];[part of the concept 4]
[category 1];[category 2]
~~~
(blank line)

[part of the concept 1];[part of the concept 2];[part of the concept 3];[part of the concept 4]
[category 1];[category 2]
